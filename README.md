## ita-corpus-samples

WIP repo for hosting VOCALOID "talkloid" samples of the ITA corpus found [here](https://github.com/mmorise/ita-corpus).

Each recitation corresponds to a VOCALOID5 Project (`vpr`) file, rendered with Hatsune Miku V4X and default parameters,
and a `wav` file; the corpus's metadata CSV is located in the project root.

Contributions for re-tuning and corrections are very welcome, but please follow the general min-max pitch, tempo,
and rhythmic sense and do not apply any effects or other processing.
